                                A lion has been seen roaming the empty science library on campus. The police, 
                                noticing the intrusion, approached the lion and asked what was his business 
                                there. The lion replied that he was attempting to learn web development, and 
                                that he found the programming portions rather interesting, but the task of 
                                laying out web page most frustrating.

                                "It is truly disappointing! Great minds, such as Don Knuth and Leslie Lamport, 
                                devoted their time to improving the art of typography and the science of 
                                optimizing the presentation of content on a page, and then here come like a 
                                band of savages these web developers, oblivious to the great work of the past, 
                                with this completely inane and baroque language!".

                                He continued, "First they invented a lot of tags. Then they fell out of love for 
                                them, and decided it's cooler to do things using the same few tags all over the 
                                place, decorating them with yet another language called CSS (the name at least it 
                                reminds me of my feeling towards it, for I know latin). So now you need two 
                                languages to get one thing accomplished! And the whole thing is so complex that 
                                to lay down something with a few columns on a page, you practically need a 
                                university degree! And look! It cannot even balance the content on these two colums, 
                                for goodness sake!"
                                The police thought it better to leave the lion alone, as he looked quite ready to 
                                bite anyone who came close.

                    </div>

                    <p class="paragraph3">
                        <i>Ray-tracing</i> is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall 
                        into an observer's eyes are retraced, so to say, in the reverse direction, to 
                        reconstruct exactly what the view would have been. This is a daunting process, 
                        because when encoutering solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the ray tracing 
                        must chase the many possible backwards paths of such scattering. Professor de Alfaro 
                        recently claimed to have invented a new, far more efficient algorithm, one that works 
                        in microseconds regardless of the dimension or complexity of the scene. "<i>There are a 
                        few restrictions,</i>" he added, "<i>and for the moment our new technique is applicable only 
                        to closed environments in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across any 
                        closed surface.</i>" The contribution is currently undergoing peer review.
